<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In the mountainous regions of Middle America there are several
groups of hylid frogs that inhabit mountain streams. Some of these
groups, such as <i>Plectrohyla</i> and <i>Ptychohyla</i>, have been elevated to
generic rank, whereas others are retained in the large and complex
genus <i>Hyla</i>. In the mountains of M&eacute;xico five species of hylids that
seem to compose a phyletic unit are herein referred to as the <i>Hyla
bistincta</i> group. Since 1955 I have been accumulating specimens
of, and data on, this group with the result that all specimens known
to me, including the types of all named taxa, have been studied.
Detailed observations have been made on the ecology and life histories
of three of the species; the other two species are known to me
only from preserved specimens.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HYLA_BISTINCTA_GROUP" id="THE_HYLA_BISTINCTA_GROUP"></a>THE HYLA BISTINCTA GROUP</h2>


<p>The five species comprising the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group are
moderate-sized hylids having rather blunt heads and robust bodies.
The fingers are long and have little webbing (Fig. 1). The skin of
the dorsum is thick and glandular, but not tuberculate. An anal
sheath is present. The skull is rather broad, flat, and solidly roofed.
The ethmoid is broad, curved downward laterally, and solidly
sutured to the frontoparietal. The nasals are broad, sutured for
their entire width with the ethmoid, and broadly in contact medially.
The premaxillaries are in contact medially; each has a long, flat
nasal process. The quadratojugal is absent, and the maxillary
tapers to a point posteriorly. There is no squamosal-maxillary
connection. The maxillary and premaxillary teeth are rather long,
bifid, and moderately spatulate. Some teeth on the premaxillary
and anterior part of the maxillary are hooked. The vomerine teeth
are spatulate and bifid. A broad, flat, ossified prepollex is present
but does not project as a spine. The known tadpoles have ventral
mouths, &#8532; tooth-rows, two or more rows of labial papillae, and
long tails with low fins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
As thus defined the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group can be distinguished
from all other groups of Middle American frogs by the combination
of absence of the quadratojugal, non-projecting prepollex, long
fingers with little webbing, and stream-inhabiting tadpoles having
&#8532; tooth rows and two or more rows of labial papillae.</p>

<p>Possibly <i>Hyla arborescandens</i> and <i>Hyla hazelae</i> belong in this
group. Because these species are somewhat different from the included
species and because their tadpoles are as yet unknown, I
have refrained from including these two species in the <i>Hyla bistincta</i>
group. Taylor (1948:261) assigned <i>Hyla proboscidea</i> (= <i>H. dalquesti</i>)
and (1949:272) <i>Hyla cyclomaculata</i> to this group, but because
these two species have a quadratojugal and notably different
tadpoles, they are excluded from the group.</p>

<p>Frogs of the genus <i>Plectrohyla</i> closely resemble species in the
<i>Hyla bistincta</i> group but differ principally in having a projecting
prepollex. In the highlands of Costa Rica a group of species, of
which <i>Hyla moesta</i> is best known, resembles species in the <i>Hyla
bistincta</i> group. At present insufficient information is available
on the Costa Rican species to determine their affinities.</p>


<h4><a name="Analysis" id="Analysis"></a>Analysis of Characters</h4>

<p>The characters used in the systematic study of the frogs in this
group are those usually employed in anuran systematics. Of the
various measurements and proportions, the snout-vent length and
the relative size of the tympanum to the eye apparently are of more
taxonomic importance than the others (Table 1). In all of the
species the tympanum is at least partially covered by a heavy,
dermal supratympanic fold, and in some specimens of <i>H. pachyderma</i>
the tympanum is completely obscured. In two species (<i>H.
bistincta</i> and <i>H. charadricola</i>) the snout is square, whereas in the
other species it is round.</p>

<p>The fingers are long and slender in <i>H. crassa</i>, <i>pachyderma</i>, and
<i>robertsorum</i> and somewhat shorter with more webbing in <i>H.
bistincta</i> and <i>charadricola</i>. Breeding males of <i>Hyla pachyderma</i>
have moderately large nuptial spines; the other species have small
spines, except <i>H. charadricola</i> in which spines apparently are
absent. A well-defined thoracic fold is present in <i>H. pachyderma</i>,
and a weak fold is present in <i>H. robertsorum</i>; the other species
lack folds. In all species there is an anal sheath; this sheath is
longest in <i>H. bistincta</i>, in which the anal opening is directed ventrally
at the level of the lower edge of the thighs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>Frogs in this group are rather drab in appearance. The dorsal
color varies from dull green to various shades of brown. The most
distinct aspect of the coloration is the different color patterns on
the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs. The flanks in all
species are marked with spots or reticulations.</p>

<p><i>Hyla bistincta</i> differs from other members of the group in having
vocal slits and a distensible vocal sac. Only this species has been
reported to call (Shannon, 1951:473). Insofar as is known, the
other species are mute. Examination of skeletal preparations of
<i>H. bistincta</i>, <i>charadricola</i>, and <i>robertsorum</i> and X-rays of the other
species shows no notable specific differences in the osteology. Since
the tadpoles of only <i>H. bistincta</i> (Duellman, 1961:47) and <i>H. robertsorum</i>
(Rabb and Mosimann, 1955) are known, larval characters are
of limited use in intra-group systematics.</p>

than width of eyelid, 3.5 mm. A heavy dermal fold from posterior
corner of eye above tympanum and curved downward to insertion of
forearm; tympanum round, its diameter slightly more than its distance
from eye. Forearm not robust; row of small pustules on ventral surface
of forearm; fold on wrist; prepollex moderately enlarged, covered with
small, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row of
spines on inner surface of second finger; subarticular tubercles

palmar tubercles rather small, flat, elliptical; fingers long,
moderately slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest,
1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on third finger slightly larger
than tympanum; rudimentary web between first and second and between
second and third fingers; web between third and fourth fingers
extending about one-fourth length of fourth finger. Heels overlap by
about one-third length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal
articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold strong,
extending to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle large, high, and
elongate; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; subarticular tubercles
moderately large, round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single rows
on proximal segments of digits; toes moderately short; length of toes
from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth toes about equal

antepenultimate phalanx of fourth toe, to discs of first, second, and
fifth toes, and to base of penultimate phalanx of third toe; discs
rather small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening
at level of lower edge of thighs; anal sheath elongate, deeply creased
medially; transverse dermal fold above anus. Skin of dorsal surfaces
of head, body, and limbs faintly areolate; skin of chin, belly, and
ventral surfaces of thighs granular, that of ventral surfaces of
limbs, except thighs, areolate; thoracic fold absent. Tongue nearly
round, slightly longer than wide, shallowly notched behind and barely
free posteriorly. Vomerine teeth 4-4, situated on rounded vomerine
ridges between rather small ovoid inner nares; vocal slits present,
situated along posterior edge of each ramus.</p>

<p>Color (in alcohol) pale brown on dorsal surfaces of head, body, and
limbs; flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs creamy white with dark
brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with creamy
white spots; belly cream-color; anal stripe absent.</p>

<p>Color (in life) pale tan on dorsal surfaces; flanks and anterior

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;There is little variation in structure. The total number
of vomerine teeth varies from 6 to 14. In some individuals the
supratympanic fold covers the upper part of the tympanum, but at least
the lower part of the tympanum is always visible. The extent of the
webbing between the toes varies from three-fourths to two-thirds
complete. Usually the web extends to some point on the antepenultimate
phalanx of the fourth toe, but in some specimens the web extends to
the base of the penultimate phalanx.</p>

<p>In the large series of specimens from Uruapan, Michoac&aacute;n, the
coloration of the flanks and anterior surfaces of the thighs varies
from nearly uniform creamy yellow with only fine dark reticulations to
bold reticulations enclosing yellow spots. Some specimens from Oaxaca
and Veracruz have slightly different markings on the flanks; in these
the dark pigment is in the form of irregular spots or dashes, instead
of reticulations.</p>

<p>There is considerable variation in color in the living frogs. The
dorsum varies from greenish tan and pale yellowish tan to reddish
brown, and some individuals are dark chocolate brown.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Shannon (1951:470) named <i>Hyla bistincta labeculata</i> on
the basis of a single male from San Lucas Camotl&aacute;n, Oaxaca; he
diagnosed the subspecies as differing from <i>Hyla bistincta bistincta</i>
by having "the gray reticulation of the sides entirely broken up into
elongate black blotches; tarsal fold moderately elevated." The
condition of the tarsal fold is characteristic of the species. The
dispersion of dark pigment on the flanks is variable. The type of
<i>Hyla bistincta labeculata</i> (USNM 123689) is extreme in the
development of dark dashes on the flanks, but this condition is
approached in several specimes from Oaxaca and Veracruz. For example,
in some specimens from Cumbres de Acultzingo, Veracruz, the mottling
on the flanks is bold; in others the flanks are reticulated. The
specimen from San Vicente, Oaxaca, has black dashes on the flanks
(Smith and Williams, 1963:23), whereas a specimen from Cerro San
Felipe, Oaxaca, has no pattern on the flanks. In general, specimens
from western M&eacute;xico have reticulate mottling on the flanks as compared
with the marbling on the flanks in specimens from eastern M&eacute;xico. On
the basis of available data, the recognition of subspecies in <i>Hyla
bistincta</i> is unwarranted.</p>

<p>The tadpoles of this species described by Duellman (1961:47) are like
those of <i>Hyla robertsorum</i> in having &#8532; tooth-rows, peglike
serrations on the beaks, and long, rounded tails. At Uruapan tadpoles
were found in a rocky stream on April 24, 1956, and metamorphosing
young were found there on August 2, 1956. A completely metamorphosed
juvenile has a snout-vent length of 24.8 mm.</p>

<p><i>Hyla bistincta</i> is found only along streams, where individuals can be
seen clinging to vines and other vegetation closely over-hanging
fast-moving parts of the stream.</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;<i>Hyla bistincta</i> occurs at elevations from 1400 to
2600 meters in the mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western
Jalisco southward through the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica in Michoac&aacute;n,
M&eacute;xico, and Morelos, the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n in Michoac&aacute;n, and the
Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and thence northward in
the Sierra Madre Oriental to central Veracruz (Fig. 2).</p>

</div>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Adult males have snout-vent lengths from 35.3 to 44.4
mm., and adult females from 43.4 to 50.9 mm. No notable variation in
structure is displayed in the type series. In some individuals the
dark reticulation on the dorsum is faint. Juveniles in life had dorsal
colorations varying from rich brown with darker reticulations to pale
green or gray with dark green reticula<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>tions. Some adults when
collected were pale green with faint or no dorsal reticulations; later
these individuals darkened. In all specimens the anal stripe is
absent, and the flanks are heavily spotted.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.&mdash;Hyla charadricola</i> differs from all other members of
the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group in the following combination of characters:
truncate snout, green dorsum, and absence of a thoracic fold. From
other hylids that occur in the same area, <i>Hyla charadricola</i> differs
from <i>Hyla miotympanum</i> and <i>H. arborescandens</i>, both of which are
green dorsally, by having a truncate snout and longer fingers with
less webbing. <i>Hyla eximia</i>, though green, has brown dorsal spots,
shorter fingers, and a round snout. <i>Hyla robertsorum</i> differs in
having a round snout and brown dorsum, and <i>Hyla taeniopus</i> is much
larger, has transverse bands on the limbs, and has extensive webbing
between fingers.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;At the type locality, a shallow rocky stream in pine
forest, <i>Hyla charadricola</i> was found beneath rocks at the edge of
fast moving sections of the stream and beneath rocks in shallow
riffles in the stream. Most of the frogs were in water. At night
they were found sitting on rocks in the stream. <i>Hyla miotympanum</i>,
which is abundant at the type locality, lives in bushes and beneath
rocks along the stream but usually is not found in the riffles inhabited
by <i>Hyla charadricola</i>. At Lago de Tejocotal <i>Hyla charadricola</i>
was found beneath rocks near the shore of the lake and by a
stream in the pine forest. Individuals were found on low vegetation
over-hanging a small stream in pine-oak forest four kilometers southwest
of Tianguistengo.</p>

<p>Five recently metamorphosed young (KU 58424-9) found at the
type locality on June 8, 1960, have snout-vent lengths of 22.4 to
24.0 (average 23.2) mm. The young are colored like the adults,
except that in life the dorsum is a brighter green and the flanks are
more yellow than tan and have less dark spotting than in adults.</p>

of 45.1 mm.; tibia length, 22.1 mm., 49.0 per cent of snout-vent
length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal
tubercle to tip of longest toe), 21.5 mm.; greatest width of head,

27.9 per cent of snout-vent length; diameter of eye, 4.0 mm.; diameter
of tympanum, 1.8 mm., 45 per cent of diameter of eye. Snout short, in
lateral profile blunt, in dorsal profile round; canthus rounded;
loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, round, and not flaring;
nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial distance, 3.6 mm.;
interorbital distance, 4.0 mm., slightly broader than width of eyelid,
3.5 mm. A moderately heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye
above tympanum and curving downward towards insertion of forearm;
tympanum nearly round, covered by dermal fold above, its diameter
slightly less than its distance from eye. Forearm moderately robust;
distinct fold on wrist; prepollex much enlarged with patch of small
nuptial spines continuous on side of digit; similar line of nuptial
spines on inner edge of second finger; subarticular tubercles round,
moderate in size, none bifid; supernumerary tubercles small and
present only proximally; fingers long and slender; length of fingers
from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on
third finger about size of tympanum; no web between first and second
fingers; rudimentary web between other fingers. Legs robust; heels
over-lap by about one-fourth length of shank when hind limbs
adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to posterior corner of
eye; tarsal fold weak, extending to about middle of tarsus; inner
metatarsal tubercle moderately large, flat, and elliptical; outer
metatarsal tubercle small, round, and indistinct; subarticular
tubercles round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single row on
proximal segments of each digit; toes moderately long and slender;
length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4, the fifth nearly
as long as third; toes nearly fully webbed; web extending to base of
penultimate phalanx of fourth toe and to discs on other toes; discs
small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening above
middle of thighs; anal sheath short, deeply creased medially; heavy
transverse dermal fold above anus; no large anal tubercles. Skin of
all dorsal surfaces, chin, and ventral surfaces of limbs, except
proximal parts of thighs, smooth; belly and proximal parts of thighs
areolate; thoracic fold present, weak. Tongue elliptical, slightly
longer than wide, not notched behind, and free posteriorly for about
one-fourth of its length; vomerine teeth 3-3, situated on small,
widely separated, transverse ridges between rather small elliptical
inner nares; no vocal slits.</p>

<p>Color (in alcohol) dark brown with irregular darker reticulations on
dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs; flanks brown with small
creamy white spots; posterior surfaces of thighs dark brown; chin
creamy tan; belly grayish brown <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>with cream-colored flecks; ventral

in anal region.</p>

<p>Color (in life) chocolate brown with darker brown reticulations and
irregular blotches above; flanks brown with yellow spots; belly gray
to grayish brown with faint cream-colored spots; iris a deep bronze
color.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;In males the total number of vomerine teeth varies from
4 to 7. In many specimens the vomerine ridges are larger and more
closely approximated medially than in the specimen described above.
Females attain snout-vent lengths of 51 mm., have as many as 9
vomerine teeth, and have a proportionately larger tympanum than males.
Some of the largest specimens of both sexes have indistinct
cream-colored pustules scattered on the ventral surface of the
forearm. Some individuals have nearly uniform grayish brown ventral
surfaces; in others the chin, as well as the abdomen, is brown with
cream-colored spots. The dorsal surfaces of some specimens are nearly
uniform dark brown with no reticulations. In others the dorsum is
paler brown with distinct darker mottling; in some of these there is
little mottling laterally, so that there is the effect of an
irregular, pale brown, dorsolateral stripe.</p>

<p><i>Tadpoles.</i>&mdash;The tadpoles of this species were described by Rabb and
Mosimann (1955). Tadpoles obtained from streams at 3.3 kilometers
north and at 8.5 kilometers southeast of Zacualtip&aacute;n, Hidalgo, are
like those described by Rabb and Mosimann in having &#8532; tooth rows,
peglike serrations on the beaks, and long rounded tails. The largest
tadpole (KU 60078) has small hind legs, a body length of 22 mm., and a
total length of 61 mm.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Taylor (1940:393) found frogs of this species in plants
along small spring-fed rivulets in an open meadow at El Chico
Parque Nacional. Also, he noted that active frogs dove into the
streams and took refuge in the mud on the bottom. Rabb and
Mosimann (1955:1) found this species along banks of tiny streams
in open meadows and noted that the frogs sought refuge in the
water. At El Chico Parque Nacional on June 8, 1960, I found <i>Hyla
robertsorum</i> under rocks along small rivulets by day; at night, when
the temperature was 14&deg; C., frogs were sitting on rocks and in
junipers overhanging a small stream. At the same locality on June
23 and 24, 1962, frogs of this species were found on rainy nights,
when the temperature varied from 10 to 12&deg; C. At this time the
frogs were sitting on the grassy banks of rivulets in the meadow.
During the day <i>Hyla robertsorum</i> was found on the earthen banks
of the rivulets in places where dense growths of grass overhung
the streams. On December 23, 1959, one specimen of <i>Hyla robertsorum</i>
was found beneath a rock in a small stream in pine forest at
3.3 kilometers north of Zacualtip&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Rabb and Mosimann (1955:1) obtained tadpoles of <i>Hyla robertsorum</i>
from quiet pools of a stream at El Chico Parque Nacional. I
found tadpoles in pools in rocky streams in pine forest at 3.3 kilometers
north and at 8.5 kilometers southeast of Zacualtip&aacute;n. Four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>

El Chico Parque Nacional have snout-vent lengths of 30.6 to
32.0 mm. Gravid females were found at the same locality on June
8, 1960, and June 23, 1962.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The following description is based on USNM 115028 from
Pan de Olla, Veracruz. Adult male having a snout-vent length of 39.9
mm.; tibia length, 21.0 mm., 52.6 per cent of snout-vent length; foot
length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to
tip of longest toe), 20.5 mm.; greatest width of head, 12.8 mm., 32.1
per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 12.3 mm., 30.8 per cent of
snout-vent length. Snout short, in lateral profile bluntly rounded, in
dorsal profile rounded; canthus rounded; loreal region slightly
concave; lips thick, round, and not flaring; nostrils slightly
protuberant; internarial distance, 2.7 mm.; interorbital distance, 3.7
mm., somewhat broader than eyelid, 2.9 mm. A heavy dermal fold from
posterior corner of eye above tympanic region and then to insertion of
forearm; tympanum completely concealed. Forearm moderately robust;
distinct fold on wrist; prepollex enlarged bearing cluster of
moderate-sized, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row
of spines present on second finger; subarticular tubercles round,
small proximally and slightly larger distally; supernumerary tubercles
small and indistinct; three palmar tubercles, median and outer partly
fused; fingers long, moderately slender; discs moderately large;
length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; second and fourth
fingers subequal in length; webbing between fingers rudimentary. Heels
overlap by about one-fourth length of shank when hind limbs adpressed;
tibiotarsal articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold
thick, low, extending nearly to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle
moderately large and round; outer metatarsal tubercle small and
indistinct; subarticular tubercles small and round; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
supernumerary tubercles small, present on proximal segments of digits; toes
moderately long and slender; length of toes from shortest to longest,
1-2-3-5-4; third and fifth toes subequal in length; toes about
three-fourths webbed; web extending to middle of penultimate phalanx
of fourth toe; discs rather small, about two-thirds size of those on
fingers. Anal opening directed posteroventrally at level of middle of
thighs; anal flap slightly elongate; thick, transverse dermal fold
above anus. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of limbs, except
thighs, smooth; skin of chin, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs
granular; thoracic fold present. Tongue nearly round, slightly notched
behind, and barely free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 3-3, situated on
posteroventral edges of small, transverse vomerine ridges between
rather large triangular inner nares; no vocal slits.</p>

<p>Color (in alcohol) of dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs dull
grayish brown with indistinct scattered darker flecks; flanks grayish
brown with cream-colored reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs
tan; chin cream-color, mottled with brown; belly creamy yellow; anal
stripe cream-color.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;In addition to the specimen described above three others
are known. One is a juvenile having a snout-vent length of 29.5 mm.,
and two are females having snout-vent lengths of 46.9 and 41.6 mm.
Variation in structure and coloration between the four specimens is
slight. In the females the tympani are partly visible and are about
one-third the diameter of the eye; the chest is mottled with brown;
the anal stripe extends laterally in the form of a row of
cream-colored dashes and spots onto the posterodorsal surfaces of the
thighs.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;On the basis of the four specimens available for study,
<i>Hyla pachyderma</i> seems to be closely related to <i>Hyla crassa</i> and
<i>Hyla robertsorum</i>. In the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group, <i>Hyla pachyderma</i>
is unique in having enlarged nuptial spines.</p>

<p>Taylor and Smith (1945:588) stated that the frogs were found on
bushes and weeds beside a small, bounding stream near Pan de Olla.
I have searched unsuccessfully for this species in the area around
Pan de Olla and Tezuitl&aacute;n.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The following description is based on UIMNH 25050 from
Cerro San Felipe, Oaxaca. Adult male having a snout-vent length of
53.7 mm.; tibia length, 26.9 mm., 50.1 per cent of snout-vent length;
foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle

interorbital distance, 4.7 mm., somewhat broader than width of eyelid,
3.8 mm. Heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum
and then to insertion of forearm; tympanum concealed above, its
diameter about equal to its distance from eye. Forearm thick; distinct
fold on wrist; prepollex enlarged bearing patch of small nuptial
spines continuous on side of digit; similar patch on second finger;

elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle small, flat, and indistinct;
subarticular tubercles small and round; single row of supernumerary
tubercles on proximal segments of each digit; toes moderately short

faint, pale cream-color.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;The only other known specimen (MNHN 6331) is a female
having a snout-vent length of 53.7 mm. and resembling the specimen
described above in most details of morphology. In MNHN 6331 the
tympanum is completely concealed, and the 8-7 vomerine teeth are
arranged in two irregular rows. The female has more cream-colored
mottling on the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs and more
distinct mottling on the throat than the male described above.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The systematic status of <i>Cauphias crassus</i> Brocchi has
been in doubt since the time of the original description. Brocchi
(1877:130) stated: "Les dernieres phalanges sont obtuses, tronqu&eacute;s a
leur extr&eacute;mit&eacute; ant&eacute;rieure." Brocchi placed the species in his genus
<i>Cauphias</i> (type species, <i>C. guatemalensis</i>), which he considered to
be related to <i>Hylodes</i> ( = <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> in the sense used by
Brocchi); he thereby placed <i>Cauphias</i> in his Hylodidae ( =
Leptodactylidae, in part). This idea of relationships was perpetuated
by Barbour (1927:96), who reported on the second known specimen of
<i>Cauphias guatemalensis</i> and stated: "When I dissected the sternum I
was at once struck by its similarity to Noble's figures of
transitional types between arciferal and firmisternal forms. The
<i>Cauphias</i> sternum recalls some of his figures for <i>Sminthillus</i> and
<i>Eleutherodactylus</i>. This genus is probably most closely related to
the latter and has probably become highly modified to meet some
peculiar environmental condition or on account of some specialized
habits as yet unknown." Kellogg (1932:118) placed <i>Cauphias</i> in the
Leptodactylidae and stated that the terminal phalanges are T-shaped.
Hartweg (1941:1) considered <i>Plectrohyla</i> to be the correct generic
name for <i>Cauphias guatemalensis</i>; he thereby relegated <i>Cauphias</i> to
the synonomy of <i>Plectrohyla</i>. Hartweg (1941:9) further showed that
the terminal phalanges of <i>Plectrohyla guatemalensis</i> were not
T-shaped and that intercalary cartilages were present. Thus, he
correctly concluded that <i>Plectrohyla guatemalensis</i> (and <i>P. crassa</i>
by implication) was a member of the family Hylidae. Stuart (1942:6)
followed Hartweg's allocations and further suggested that <i>Plectrohyla
crassa</i> might be the same species as <i>Hyla</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
<i>robustofemora</i> Taylor. In his description of <i>H. robustofemora</i>
Taylor (1940:392), who had not examined the type of <i>Cauphias crassus</i>,
stated that were it not for the statements of Brocchi and Kellogg that
<i>C. crassus</i> has T-shaped terminal phalanges, "I might suspect I had
before me a specimen of <i>Cauphias</i> closely related to <i>crassum</i>."</p>

<p>I have compared the type of <i>Cauphias crassus</i> with that of <i>Hyla
robustofemora</i>. With the exception of the minor differences mentioned
in the preceding section on variation, the specimens are
alike, leaving little doubt that they represent the same species. The
statements of Brocchi and Kellogg to the contrary, the type of
<i>Cauphias crassus</i> possesses intercalary cartilages between the penultimate
and terminal phalanges; the latter are not T-shaped, but
as in the type of <i>Hyla robustofemora</i>, resemble those typical of
<i>Hyla</i>. On the basis of the morphological characters, as pointed out
for <i>Hyla robustofemora</i> by Taylor (1940:392), <i>Hyla crassa</i> is a
member of the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group.</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;This species is definitely known only from a small stream at
an elevation of 2300 meters in the mountains of central Oaxaca (Fig. 4).</p>

<h2><a name="RELATIONSHIPS" id="RELATIONSHIPS"></a>RELATIONSHIPS</h2>

<p>The evolutionary trend in the members of the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group is
towards aquatic habits. <i>Hyla bistincta</i>, the least specialized
species in the group, has relatively short fingers, webbing between
the fingers, a truncate, high snout, and relatively large subarticular
and supernumerary tubercles. <i>Hyla charadricola</i> resembles <i>bistincta</i>
in having relatively short fingers, a slight amount of webbing, and a
truncate snout. Apparently these two species are more closely related
to one another than either is to the other species in the group. <i>Hyla
robertsorum</i>, <i>pachyderma</i>, and <i>crassa</i> are the most aquatic members
of the group. These species are closely related, possibly conspecific.
All have round, sloping snouts, robust forearms, long, unwebbed
fingers, and large webbed feet. Both <i>H. pachyderma</i> and <i>H. crassa</i>
seem to be advanced beyond <i>H. robertsorum</i>. If small nuptial spines,
moderately webbed feet, and absence of a well-defined thoracic fold
are considered to be less advanced than large nuptial spines and a
strong thoracic fold, as in <i>H. pachyderma</i>, or fully webbed feet, as
in <i>H. crassa</i>, then <i>H. robertsorum</i> must be considered to be less
advanced than <i>H. pachyderma</i> or <i>H. crassa</i>.</p>

<p>Members of the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group inhabit mountain streams.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
The frogs can be found along these streams throughout the year. Since in
most stream-breeding hylids there is no migration to breeding sites,
the breeding call does not function to attract females to the breeding
site. Apparently voices are lacking in all members of the <i>Hyla
bistincta</i> group, except in <i>Hyla bistincta</i>. The presence of vocal
slits and the ability to call further indicate that <i>Hyla bistincta</i>
is the primitive member of this group.</p>

<p>Members of the <i>Hyla bistincta</i> group and the species of <i>Plectrohyla</i>
closely resemble each other in osteology and body form of the adults
and in structure of the tadpoles. This resemblance suggests a close
relationship between the two groups. <i>Plectrohyla</i> apparently evolved
from an ancestral stock resembling the extant <i>Hyla bistincta</i>.
Probably this stock gave rise independently to <i>Plectrohyla</i> and to
the <i>Hyla robertsorum-pachyderma-crassa</i> complex. In the former the
voice was retained, and a projecting prepollex spine developed,
whereas in the latter the voice was lost, and the prepollex spine did
not project. <i>Plectrohyla</i> lives in mountain streams in the
Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands; the <i>Hyla robertsorum-pachyderma-crassa</i>
complex inhabits similar environments in the Sierra Madre Oriental in
M&eacute;xico. <i>Hyla charadricola</i> also lives in the Sierra Madre Oriental,
whereas <i>Hyla bistincta</i> is widespread in the mountains of M&eacute;xico
southeastward to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
